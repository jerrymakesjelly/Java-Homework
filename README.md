It is just a backup of my Java homework. Thanks to my Java teacher Jie LI. :smile:

## Contents
### Homework 1: Class and Array
Simple.

### Homework 2: Exception
Defined two exception classes named *ScoreException*, *StudentNumberException* based on the homework 1. Throw exceptions when the input is invalid.

### Homework 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism(多态)
Use inheritance to define the following 5 classes:

### Homework 4: Collection(群体对象)
Based on the homework 3, defined a class named *factory* and save all the employees into its HashMap.

### Homework 5: GUI
Designed a graphic user interface to input the employee and calculate their average salary information based on the homework 3.

### Homework 6: Design Pattern Practice 1(Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern and Strategy Pattern)
Designed an online shopping system(actually it's not online). The relations of the classes in the system is shown below.

### Homework 7: Design Pattern Practice 2 (More complex)
Use **Singleton Pattern**, **Factory Pattern**, **Strategy Pattern**, **Composite Pattern**, **Observer Pattern** to build a online shopping system, and use **Swing** to design a graphic user interface for it.

In the end, this is my class diagram which is generated by Eclipse Java Oxygen:

And these is the screenshot of my online shopping system, which is recorded by [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif):

It's really fun!
